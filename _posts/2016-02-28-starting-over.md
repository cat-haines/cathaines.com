 Sometimes you just gotta burn it all to the ground

When I'm in the mood for change, I usually try to create or advocate for small incremental steps rather than tearing down the existing structures and starting from scratch.. but sometimes, for a variety of reasons, I want to burn things to the ground.

_I needed to burn some things down._

_I don't know why. I just do._

That's actually a lie.. a tremendous amount of change has happened in my life over the past year. I found a new job, I feel short in some technical interviews in the process and lost faith in my technical abilities, I came out as trans, twice.. kind of, and I went through an intense, and very long bout of depression lasting the better part of the year.

So it's time to regroup, and refocus - starting with my blog.
