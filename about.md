I'm the lead developer advocate at a smartwatch company called [Pebble][pebble]! In a previous life, I ran community at [Electric Imp][electricimp], and started [CrashBang Labs][cbl] (a hackerspace in my hometown).

I build communities for curious tinkerers, hardware that lives on the web, and tools for other developers.

My pronouns are she/her.
